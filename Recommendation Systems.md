#### Personal Project Idea :
  - **Personalised DSA Problems Recommendation System**
    - `Problem Statement` : 
    - Do I really need to use NLP to suggest recommended problems ?
    - Will matching similar tags be just enough or RegEx ? --> Find existing solutions for this problem statement, if any.
    - How are current platforms solving or implementing this ?
      1. take `Leetcode` example, maybe ?
    - I know Semantic Similarity will not just be enough, have to consider Programmatic Complexity of the problem as well
    - What kind of data can I collect to understand the user behaviour and preferences or patterns ? - RecSys 101
    - what kind of RecSys algorithm can we implement or use for solving the problem ? --> will cosine similarity just be enough ? NO I think
